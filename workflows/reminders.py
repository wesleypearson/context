Queue Reminders
===============

Push due reminders into the owner's inbound queue. @context files reminders in
`crm.reminders` with a due date; this is the watcher that surfaces them once due.

A due reminder is always filed into the inbound queue, so it lands on the rundown
alongside everything else awaiting the owner — one surface, not several. The hourly
sweep *also* sends a best-effort Slack DM (a nudge so a timed reminder reaches the
owner the moment it's due); the queue stays the source of truth, so a failed DM
never fails the sweep. The manual tool skips the DM — you're already looking at the
result when you ask in chat.

Three entry points, one core (`_queue_reminders`):
- `queue_reminders` — owner tool, for "push my due reminders now" in chat (no DM).
- `queue_reminders_step` — what the hourly schedule runs, so the sweep fires without
  the model deciding to call a tool. This path sends the Slack nudge.
- `_queue_reminders` — the shared core: claim each due reminder, file it, mark it
  surfaced so it shows once, and (only when asked) DM the owner.

Owner-only on every path (the scheduler's verified identity counts as the owner).
The workflow is registered with AgentOS and run by the hourly `queue-reminders`
schedule; the tool is wired onto the context agent (see `app/schedules.py`).
