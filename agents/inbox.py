"""
The Inbound Queue
===========================

Let your teammates (and their agents) leave you non-urgent updates.

Four tools for managing your inbound queue:
- `submit_update` — a guest's write. Append-only to the owner's queue. `from_person` is taken from the verified identity so a caller can't spoof who an update is from. No readback into the owner's data — you can drop a note in the owner's inbox, you can't read the inbox.
- `my_updates` — a guest's *own* receipts: the updates this verified caller has left, and whether the owner has seen them. The filter is the caller's verified identity, closed over in code — it can never return another sender's rows, let alone the owner's data. The asymmetry survives: anyone can write, and can see what *they* wrote; only the owner reads the queue.
- `rundown` — owner-only. Everything awaiting the owner: every update they haven't acknowledged, grouped blocked → done → in progress. Shows them and advances `new → briefed`, stamping `briefed_at`.
- `acknowledge` — owner-only. Moves updates to `acknowledged` (stamping `acknowledged_at`) so they drop off the rundown, then best-effort DMs each human submitter a one-line receipt. Only the owner moves the ack axis — and that falls out of the toolset for free (a guest never holds these tools).

The owner-only tools also check `is_owner` and raise `StopAgentRun` — redundant behind the toolset gate + the tool_hook in `agents.policy`, but a cheap defense none the less.
