Context Policy
==============

Everything @context decides from the caller's verified identity, in one place:

- The **surface**: which system prompt and which tools the caller gets. This is the
  primary owner/guest boundary — `context_tools` hands the owner the full provider
  surface and a guest only the capture surface (`submit_update`, `my_updates` over
  their own submissions, and free/busy `owner_availability` when the calendar is
  connected — each scoped to the caller's verified identity in code), and
  `context_instructions` renders the matching guide. The toolset is chosen here, in
  code, before the model runs, so "a guest can't read the owner's data" is
  structural, not a prompt rule.
- The **hooks**: defense in depth on top of that surface — `normalize_identity`
  (pre-hook) refuses unidentified prod runs and collapses the owner's aliases;
  `enforce_capture_only` (tool-hook) soft-blocks any non-capture tool from a guest.

Both key off `app.identity.is_owner`. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.
