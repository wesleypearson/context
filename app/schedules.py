Schedules
=========

@context's background schedules — the cron registration that decides which jobs
fire and when. This is a cross-cutting concern: the scheduler can drive agents or
workflows, so it lives here rather than inside `workflows/` (a catalog of runnable
things). The `Workflow` objects it points at are defined in `workflows/`.

`register_schedules()` is idempotent (safe on every boot) and called from the
AgentOS lifespan in `app/main.py`.

def register_schedules() -> None:
    """Register @context's background schedules (idempotent — safe on every boot).

    The scheduler poller (`scheduler=True`) fires each due job against an HTTP
    endpoint; AgentOS authenticates those triggers with the internal service
    token, so the runs arrive as the `__scheduler__` identity that `is_owner`
    honors — i.e. on the owner surface. A failure here must not take startup
    down, so it degrades to a warning.

    - queue-reminders: hourly, the schedule hits the `queue-reminders` workflow
      (`/workflows/queue-reminders/runs`), whose one step calls `_queue_reminders`
      and sweeps `crm.reminders` for anything now due into the inbound queue
      (see `workflows/reminders.py`). It's a workflow, not an agent run, so the
      sweep fires deterministically — no model deciding whether to call a tool.

    - daily-digest / weekly-digest: registered **only when Slack is configured**
      (delivery is a Slack DM, so there's no point arming them otherwise). Each
      hits its digest workflow, which runs a read-only playbook as the owner and
      DMs the result (see `workflows/digest.py`). Cron is tunable via
      `DAILY_DIGEST_CRON` / `WEEKLY_DIGEST_CRON` (UTC); defaults are a daily
      13:00 UTC rundown and a Sunday-evening week-plan.
