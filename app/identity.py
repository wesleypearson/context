Identity Validation
===================

When you make a request to the AgentOS API, you provide the user's identity in the `user_id` form field and as a JWT via the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

AgentOS extracts the user's identity (sub) from the JWT and stores it in `run_context.user_id`. The user_id is then compared against the configured owner id(s) to determine if the caller is the owner. See `docs/SECURITY.md` for more details.

Different systems provide the user_id in different ways:
- **AgentOS API:** When `authorization=True`, AgentOS extracts the `sub` from the JWT and prefers it over the caller-supplied `user_id` form field (non-forgeable).
- **Slack:** The Slack interface maps the author's email to the user_id and sets it as the run's `user_id` when `resolve_user_identity=True`. If the profile has no email, the raw `Uxxxx` id is used.
- **Dev:** The provided `user_id` (forgeable — there's no auth locally, which is why prod must run with auth on).

We compare the provided user_id against the configured owner id(s) in `OWNER_ID`.

`OWNER_ID` is a comma-separated list of identities across surfaces (email, Slack email, raw Slack id) that resolve to the owner. The **first** entry is canonical — the `user_id` the inbound queue rows are written under and read back by.

If no `OWNER_ID` is set, `OWNER_IDS` is empty and `is_owner` is always `False` — every caller gets the capture-only surface.
Production must set `OWNER_ID` (and run with auth on) for the owner to have any privileged access.

The scheduler runs as the owner's automation.

AgentOS's scheduler sends requests over HTTP that are authenticated using the OS's *internal service token*. The auth middleware resolves that token to the verified identity `"__scheduler__"` (the run route prefers it over any payload `user_id`, same as a JWT `sub`). `is_owner` accepts it whenever an owner is configured, so scheduled playbooks (the daily rundown) run with owner level permissions. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.
