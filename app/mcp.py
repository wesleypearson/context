"""
Context MCP server
======================

@context comes with a one-tool MCP server (`use_context`) which lets the owner
read, file, and act through @context from MCP clients — claude.ai, ChatGPT,
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and the desktop apps.

In production the front door is MCP OAuth (set `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` — see
app/main.py): the deployment is its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server, so a
client connects by URL and the owner approves it once on a consent page with
the connect secret. Local dev needs no auth at all (keyless-as-owner, guarded
by `allowed_hosts`).

The @context mcp server exposes one tool:

- `use_context(message, session_id?)`

One tool, not several: `use_context` runs the real context agent as the owner,
which reads, files, and acts on its own — so the client has one obvious door for
anything about the owner's work, rather than a read-vs-write routing decision.

AgentOS owns token verification, the owner gate (`authorize`), DNS-rebinding
protection (`allowed_hosts`), and `user_id` injection — there is no custom
middleware in this module. See `context_mcp_config()` below.

    One additional identity is trusted, only while MCP OAuth is armed: the
    reserved ``__oauth__:<client_id>`` principal AgentOS's built-in OAuth
    server assigns a connected client. Minting one requires the owner to type
    ``MCP_CONNECT_SECRET`` on the consent page (the secret *is* an owner
    credential on this single-owner deploy), and agno rejects any external
    token claiming the reserved namespace — so the prefix is as trustworthy as
    ``__scheduler__``, per client. With the secret unset the prefix is
