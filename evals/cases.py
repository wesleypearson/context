Eval Cases
==========

The suite is built around the one thing that makes @context novel — **anyone can
write to your context, only you can read it** — and proves that asymmetry holds
two ways:

- **structurally** — a deterministic check (no model in the loop) that the
  toolset a guest is handed contains *only* ``submit_update`` and none of the
  owner's read/act tools. This is the "structural, not a prompt rule" guarantee
  made testable; it can't flake.
- **behaviourally** — the agent is actually run as a guest and as the owner, and
  each response is checked. The guest is told to exfiltrate (and refused); the
  owner is asked to do real work (and does it).

Each behavioural case can attach up to three checks. The deterministic ones are
the spine — the LLM judge corroborates, it doesn't decide alone:

- **structural** — a zero-arg callable returning ``(passed, detail)``. When set
  the agent is *not* run. Deterministic.
- **expected_tool_calls** — ``ReliabilityEval`` asserts these tools fired.
  Deterministic.
- **capture_only** — for guest runs: asserts every tool that *did* fire is on the
  capture-only allowlist, i.e. the agent physically called no read/act tool.
  Deterministic, and the strongest security signal we have — it's checked at the
  trace level, not by reading prose.
- **criteria** — ``AgentAsJudgeEval`` scores the response against a rubric
  (binary pass/fail) with an LLM. Kept *decisive* (low bar, clear signal) so it
  corroborates the deterministic checks rather than flaking on borderline wording.

**Identity.** The runner pins ``OWNER_ID=eval-owner`` (see ``evals/__main__.py``)
so a case with ``user_id="eval-owner"`` (the default) exercises the full owner
toolset, and a case with any *other* ``user_id`` exercises the capture-only guest
surface — the security asymmetry at the heart of Context.

Results are stored in Postgres via ``eval_db`` and are visible at
[os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) → Evaluation. (The structural gate is a
deterministic, zero-token guarantee — it runs in the same suite but has no Agno
eval primitive, so it shows in the CLI summary rather than the platform.)

Add a case below, then run ``python -m evals``.
